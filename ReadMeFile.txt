RestTemplate is a synchronous client to perform HTTP requests in Spring.
It's part of the Spring Framework and allows you to interact with RESTful web services.
You can use it to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP requests.
Below are some of the commonly used methods in RestTemplate:

Key Methods in RestTemplate
GET Requests

getForObject(String url, Class<T> responseType, Object... uriVariables): Fetches a resource by URL, automatically converting it to the specified response type.
getForEntity(String url, Class<T> responseType, Object... uriVariables): Similar to getForObject, but returns a ResponseEntity object, which includes HTTP status code, headers, and the response body.
POST Requests

postForObject(String url, Object request, Class<T> responseType, Object... uriVariables): Sends a POST request to the specified URL and converts the response body to the specified type.
postForEntity(String url, Object request, Class<T> responseType, Object... uriVariables): Similar to postForObject, but returns a ResponseEntity.
PUT Requests

put(String url, Object request, Object... uriVariables): Sends a PUT request to the specified URL.
DELETE Requests

delete(String url, Object... uriVariables): Sends a DELETE request to the specified URL.
Exchange Method

exchange(String url, HttpMethod method, HttpEntity<?> requestEntity, Class<T> responseType, Object... uriVariables): Executes a request with the specified HTTP method, request entity, and response type. This method is very flexible and allows you to customize the request and response handling.
Other Methods

headForHeaders(String url, Object... uriVariables): Retrieves all headers of the resource specified by the URL.
optionsForAllow(String url, Object... uriVariables): Retrieves the allowed HTTP methods for a resource specified by the URL.


Used FetchAndCascadeTypes application as third party app.

Here I make http request call to get and post data, when I get response back, usually third party API
sends json format, so I have created DTO classes to map and get json data to DTO class, Then I have
converted DTO to Author and Book entities and returned it. Instead of returning entity, we can
return DTO directly. Entities are required when only store and fetch data from db.

Here we are getting data and sending data to third party APIs so entities are not required.
